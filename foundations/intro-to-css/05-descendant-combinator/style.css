/* You can use either type or class selectors for this exercise; use whichever you may feel you 
want to practice with more. The HTML file is set up (so no need to edit anything in it) such 
that any combination of selectors will work, so if you're feeling adventurous you can even try 
combining a type and class selector for the descendant combinator. */
